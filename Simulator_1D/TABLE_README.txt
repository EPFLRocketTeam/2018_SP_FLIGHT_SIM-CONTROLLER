The control table has three columns, the first one is the measured altitude
the second one is the measured vertical velocity and the third one is 
the nominal airbrake opening angle to reach the target apogee for the given 
altitude and vertical velocity condtions. 

The table is ordered by growing velocity and then by growing altitude.
